## Usage

### Sync list of product drafts

#### Prerequisites
1. The sync expects a list of non-null `ProductDraft` objects that have their `key` fields set to match the
products from the source to the target. Also the target project is expected to have the `key` fields set,
otherwise they won't be matched.
2. Every product may have several references including `product type`, `categories`, `taxCategory`, etc.. Variants
of the product also have prices, where each prices also has some references including a reference to the `Type` of its 
custom fields and a reference to a `channel`. All these referenced resources are matched by their `key` Therefore, in 
order for the sync to resolve the actual ids of those references, those `key`s have to be supplied in one of two ways:
    - Provide the `key` value on the `id` field of the reference. This means that calling `getId()` on the
    reference would return its `key`. Note that the library will check that this `key` is not 
    provided in `UUID` format by default. However, if you want to provide the `key` in `UUID` format, you can
     set it through the sync options. <!--TODO Different example of sync performed that way can be found [here]().-->
    - Provide the reference expanded. This means that calling `getObj()` on the reference should not return `null`,
     but return the `Type` object, from which the its `key` can be directly accessible. 
     
        **Note**: This library provides you with a utility method 
         [`replaceProductsReferenceIdsWithKeys`](https://commercetools.github.io/commercetools-sync-java/v/v1.0.0-M2-beta-2/com/commercetools/sync/commons/utils/SyncUtils.html#replaceProductsReferenceIdsWithKeys-java.util.List-)
         that replaces the references id fields with keys, in order to make them ready for reference resolution by the sync:
         ````java
         // Puts the keys in the reference id fields to prepare for reference resolution
         final List<ProductDraft> productDrafts = replaceProductsReferenceIdsWithKeys(products);
         ````
     
3. It is an important responsibility of the user of the library to instantiate a `sphereClient` that has the following properties:
    - Limits the amount of concurrent requests done to CTP. This can be done by decorating the `sphereClient` with 
   [QueueSphereClientDecorator](http://commercetools.github.io/commercetools-jvm-sdk/apidocs/io/sphere/sdk/client/QueueSphereClientDecorator.html) 
    - Retries on 5xx errors with a retry strategy. This can be achieved by decorating the `sphereClient` with the 
   [RetrySphereClientDecorator](http://commercetools.github.io/commercetools-jvm-sdk/apidocs/io/sphere/sdk/client/RetrySphereClientDecorator.html)
   
   You can use the same client instantiating used in the integration tests for this library found 
   [here](/src/main/java/com/commercetools/sync/commons/utils/ClientConfigurationUtils.java#L45).

4. After the `sphereClient` is setup, a `ProductSyncOptions` should be be built as follows: 
````java
// instantiating a ProductSyncOptions
final ProductSyncOptions productSyncOptions = ProductSyncOptionsBuilder.of(sphereClient).build();
````

The options can be used to provide additional optional configuration for the sync as well:
- `errorCallBack`
a callback that is called whenever an event occurs during the sync process that represents an error. Currently, these 
events.

- `warningCallBack` 
a callback that is called whenever an event occurs during the sync process that represents a warning. Currently, these 
events.
<!--
- `removeOtherLocales`
a flag which enables the sync module to add additional localizations without deleting existing ones, if set to `false`. 
If set to `true`, which is the default value of the option, it deletes the existing object properties.
- `removeOtherSetEntries`
a flag which enables the sync module to add additional Set entries without deleting existing ones, if set to `false`. 
If set to `true`, which is the default value of the option, it deletes the existing Set entries.
- `removeOtherCollectionEntries`
a flag which enables the sync module to add collection (e.g. Assets, Images etc.) entries without deleting existing 
ones, if set to `false`. If set to `true`, which is the default value of the option, it deletes the existing collection 
entries.
- `removeOtherProperties`
a flag which enables the sync module to add additional object properties (e.g. custom fields, etc..) without deleting 
existing ones, if set to `false`. If set to `true`, which is the default value of the option, it deletes the existing 
object properties. -->
- `syncFilter`
 represents either a blacklist or a whitelist for filtering certain update action groups. 
  - __Blacklisting__ an update action group means that everything in products will be synced except for any group 
  in the blacklist. A typical use case it to blacklist prices when syncing products, so as to sync everything in products
  except prices. [Here](/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/integration/externalsource/products/ProductSyncFilterIT.java#L142-L143)
  is an example where the sync is performed while blacklisting product categories. 
  
  - __Whitelisting__ an update action group means that the groups in this whitelist will be the *only* group synced in 
  products. One use case could be to whitelist prices when syncing products, so as to only sync prices in products and
  nothing else. [Here](/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/integration/externalsource/products/ProductSyncFilterIT.java#L173)
  is an example where the sync is performed while whitelisting product names.
  
  - The list of action groups allowed to be blacklist or whitelisted on products can be found [here](/src/main/java/com/commercetools/sync/products/ActionGroup.java). 

- `updateActionsCallBack`
a filter function which can be applied on generated list of update actions to produce a resultant list after the filter 
function has been applied.
- `allowUuid`
a flag, if set to `true`, enables the user to use keys with UUID format for references. By default, it is set to `false`.

Example of options usage, that sets the error and warning callbacks to output the message to the log error and warning 
streams, would look as follows:
 ```java
 final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MySync.class);
 final ProductSyncOptions productsyncOptions = ProductSyncOptionsBuilder.of(sphereClient)
                                                                        .setErrorCallBack(logger::error)
                                                                        .setWarningCallBack(logger::warn)
                                                                        .build();
 ```

#### Running the sync
After all the aforementioned points in the previous section have been fulfilled, to run the sync:
````java
// instantiating a product sync
final ProductSync productSync = new ProductSync(productSyncOptions);

// execute the sync on your list of products
CompletionStage<ProductSyncStatistics> syncStatisticsStage = productSync.sync(productDrafts);
````
The result of the completing the `syncStatisticsStage` in the previous code snippet contains a `ProductSyncStatistics`
which contains all the stats of the sync process; which includes a report message, the total number of updated, created, 
failed, processed categories and the processing time of the sync in different time units and in a
human readable format.
````java
final ProductSyncStatistics stats = syncStatisticsStage.toCompletebleFuture().join();
stats.getReportMessage(); 
/*"Summary: 2000 products were processed in total (1000 created, 995 updated and 5 products failed to sync)."*/
````

__Note__ The statistics object contains the processing time of the last batch only. This is due to two reasons:
 1. The sync processing time should not take into account the time between supplying batches to the sync. 
 2. It is not not known by the sync which batch is going to be the last one supplied.


More examples of how to use the sync
1. From another CTP project as source can be found [here](/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/integration/ctpprojectsource/products/ProductSyncIT.java).
2. From an external source can be found [here](/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/integration/externalsource/products/ProductSyncIT.java). 
3. Syncing with blacklisting/whitelisting [here](/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/integration/externalsource/products/ProductSyncFilterIT.java).


### Build all update actions

A utility method provided by the library to compare a Product with a new ProductDraft and results in a list of product
 update actions. 
```java
List<UpdateAction<Product>> updateActions = ProductSyncUtils.buildActions(product, productDraft, productSyncOptions, attributesMetaData);
```

Examples of its usage can be found in the tests 
[here](/src/test/java/com/commercetools/sync/products/utils/ProductSyncUtilsTest.java).


### Build particular update action(s)

Utility methods provided by the library to compare the specific fields of a Product and a new ProductDraft, and in turn builds
 the update action. One example is the `buildChangeNameUpdateAction` which compares names:
  
````java
Optional<UpdateAction<Product>> updateAction = buildChangeNameUpdateAction(oldProduct, productDraft);
````
More examples of those utils for different fields can be found [here](/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/integration/externalsource/products/utils).

## Caveats
1. Products are either created or updated. Currently the tool does not support product deletion.
2. The library doesn't sync product variant assets yet [#3](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/issues/3), but it will not delete them.
3. The library will not sync attribute field types with `ReferenceType` and `SetType` field definitions, except 
for Product references. (See more: [#87](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/issues/87) [#160](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/issues/87))
